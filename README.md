# FaceRecognition - Currently is setup for detecting human faces and it works.
# Project was to detect my dog and scare her from coming into the baby's nursery with sound and pehaps a compressed air can. haarcascades is very rudimentary and does not support dog faces.
# Training a new set of haarcascades isn't a productive way to spend my study time since the technology has been abandoned.
# Cats and Human faces/eyes and a few more are supported by haarcascades. I won't implement this code since the technology is not adequate to my project's need.
